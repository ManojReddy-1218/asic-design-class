# ASIC Lab2 
## Aim: 
To compile a file using RISCV compiler and verifying it with GCC compiler

## Step1: 
Compile the sum1ton.c file using GCC compiler using the following commands.
```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
## Step2: 
Compile the sum1ton.c file using RISCV compiler using the following commands.
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
## Step3:
Start debugging the file with the help of object dump file using the following commands
```
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```

## Step4:
Observe the change value of registers before compiling and after compiling using the following commands
```
reg 0 a2
reg 0 a2
reg 0 sp
```
